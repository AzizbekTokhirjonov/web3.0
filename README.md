# web3.0

This application is being built for testing purposes and learning. 

No credentials given hidden in env intentionaly as there is not any danger nor value. It is just for learning how blockchain and web 3.0 works.

1 You can see the React Code in the /client folder
2 You can see the Solidity contract /smart_contract folder

This version is a just first step and I will keep imporving the app.

Thanks a lot!
